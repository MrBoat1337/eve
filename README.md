Eve
----------------

Eve is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Eve uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Eve is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.
EVE has a network time of three minutes and adjusts difficulty every block using Digishield.
Thanks to Digishield from the Digibyte developers.
Eve uses sha256 and has 32 "coins" per block found.
Focus for long term developing the network and dedication is part of the core focus within EVE.
Crypto Community involvement is encouraged in the direction to which the network expands. 

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Eve client software, see http://www.Eve.info
